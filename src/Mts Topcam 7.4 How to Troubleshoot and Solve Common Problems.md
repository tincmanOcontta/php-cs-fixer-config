MTS Topcam 7.4 also provides a realistic simulation of the machining process on different virtual machines. Users can check the tool paths, collisions, cycle times and material removal before sending the program to the real machine. The simulation can be done in the NC code of the target control or in a graphical mode[^1^]. Users can also define new machine models with the extension module MachineAssembler[^2^].
 
MTS Topcam 7.4 is a complete and powerful CAD/CAM software that can help users optimize their production and improve their skills. It is compatible with all standard files and native interfaces of other CAD software, such as DXF/DWG, IGES, STEP, Parasolid and more. It also offers a user-friendly interface, a secure and collaborative environment, and a flexible and parametric system[^2^].
 
MTS Topcam 7.4 is available for download from the Software Informer website[^3^]. Users can also contact MTS GmbH Berlin for more information about the software license and support[^1^].

## Features and Benefits of MTS Topcam 7.4
 
MTS Topcam 7.4 is a software solution that covers the entire CNC programming and simulation process, from design to machining. It offers a range of features and benefits that make it a suitable choice for CNC programmers, operators, trainers and students. Some of these features and benefits are:
 
- It is part of the MTS CNC System, which is a comprehensive and integrated solution for CNC and CAM education and production. Users can access different modules and functions within the same system, such as TopTrain for e-learning, TopCAT for setup activities, TopFix for fixture design, NCTest for NC code testing, TopCAM2D for 2D machining and TopCAM3D for 3D machining.
- It supports various CNC controls and machines, such as PAL2009, UTC, Fanuc, Heidenhain, Siemens, Mazak and more. Users can create and edit ISO programs for different types of machines, such as lathes, milling machines, machining centers and multi-tasking machines. Users can also define their own machine models with the MachineAssembler module.
- It provides a realistic and accurate simulation of the machining process on different virtual machines. Users can check the tool paths, collisions, cycle times and material removal before sending the program to the real machine. The simulation can be done in the NC code of the target control or in a graphical mode. Users can also customize the simulation environment with different views, colors, lighting and sounds.
- It allows users to import 3D-step milling workpiece data and use the feature recognition function of TopCAM3D to automatically assign tools and technologies for machining. It can recognize features such as boreholes, rectangular, circular pockets and any other contour pockets with islands, groves as well as any other free cutting of contour areas with islands. It can also make suggestions for tools and technologies and offer optimization algorithms for roughing tools.
- It is compatible with all standard files and native interfaces of other CAD software, such as DXF/DWG, IGES, STEP, Parasolid and more. It also supports the import of PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) such as features, geometric and dimensional tolerances, and surface finishes. It also offers the FreeShape function to directly modify the imported solids and apply reconstructions to machine them more quickly.
- It offers a user-friendly interface, a secure and collaborative environment, and a flexible and parametric system. Users can easily access different functions and menus from the toolbar or the context menu. Users can also work in a team with shared projects and files.
